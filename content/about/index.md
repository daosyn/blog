Hi!
My name is Brandon Dao.

Alternatively, you can import my public key directly to GPG:

A few things about me:

- I am currently a software developer at Capital One, working on building modern web applications.
- Computers have always been something I enjoyed tinkering with, albeit typically without purpose.
- Being one of the first users of a technology has always gotten me excited in some inexplicable way.
- Keeping things as plain and simple as possible is something I strive for.
- Things I enjoy outside of staring at digital screens include
ping pong,
[Gunpla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam_model),
collecting vintage Seiko watches,
going to post-punk concerts,
and
reading magical realism novels.

Most of my online profiles can be found back at my [home page](/).

Hi!
My name is Brandon Dao.

I am currently a software developer at Capital One, working on building modern web applications.

</ul>

Alternatively, you can import my public key directly to GPG:

```shell
curl https://daosyn.info/pubkey.asc | gpg --import
```

Thoughts that are tangible in any way will be shared on this blog.
For short form thoughts, find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daosyn).

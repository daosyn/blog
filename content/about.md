Hi!
My name is Brandon Dao.

<ul>

<li><a href="/pubkey.asc" download>download public key</a></li>
</ul>

Alternatively, you can import my public key directly to GPG:

```shell
curl https://daosyn.info/pubkey.asc | gpg --import
```
I am currently a software developer at Capital One, working on building modern web applications.
Computers have always been something I enjoyed tinkering with, albeit typically without purpose.
Being one of the first users of a technology always gets me excited in some inexplicable way.
Hopefully, I will be able to develop my interests into something more tangible (and marketable).

My hobbies outside of staring at computer screens include ping pong, Gunpla, and collecting vintage watches.
